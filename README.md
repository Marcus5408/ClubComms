# ClubComms

This was supposed to be a web app for Brooklyn Tech students to consolidate all of the communication channels from their clubs. Unfortunately, due to some, circumstances (Spectrum being a terrible ISP and randomly deciding to delete itself), I could not push the final few commits to this repo. The unfinished project is up though, and itâ€™s available at [https://matchaflavored.site/clubcomms](https://matchaflavored.site/clubcomms). A placeholder demo that was meant to be replaced also exists, at [https://matchaflavored.site/clubcomms/demo](https://matchaflavored.site/clubcomms/demo).

This README was updated using theWorking Copy app on my phone because my internet still isn't back on after two and a half hours.
